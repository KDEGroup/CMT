### CMT

#### HG_Encoder

python HG_Encoder.py

#### Temporal Snapshot Sequence(TSS)

1. Get the representation for each user under different snapshots:

   ```python
   python pretrainHeteroDynamic.py
   ```

2. Run Transformer Encoder to transform the obtained user behavioral sequences into constructed tss feature:

   ```python
   python TFEncoder_tss.py
   ```

#### User Relation Sequence(URS)

1. Construct and sample the user relation sequence for each user:

   ```python
   # run user_seq_construct()
   python Input.py
   ```

2. Run Transformer Encoder to transform the obtained user relation sequence into constructed tss feature:

   ```python
   python TFEncoder_urs.py
   ```

#### Sequence Constrastive Learning

run the following scipt to acquire the sequential feautre transformed with Transformer Encoder by multi-task learning with contrastive learning.

```python
# Temporal Snapshot Sequence
python contrastive/tss.py
# User Relation Sequence
python contrastive/urs.py
```

#### Combine Together

Concat the two sequential features (tss and urs)  with raw feature as the input of graph classification model at  current timestamp.

```python
python concat/tss_cl_urs_cl.py
```
